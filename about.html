    <p id="About-Me">Hi! I <strike>study Mathematics and Economics at the University of Chicago</strike>&nbsp; work in strategy consulting in Chicago. 
    <br><br>The biggest constant throughout my life has been my love for food. I created this blog as a way for me to challenge myself after graduating from UChicago, not only by learning how to create and maintain my own website, but also by pushing myself to use this space as a creative outlet. My goal is to further and document my growth one dish at a time, and I hope you join me.</p>
