    <p id="About-Me">As you probably already know, my name is xx. I'm a <strike>Northeast Ohio high schooler</strike>&nbsp; <strike>Mathematics and Economics student at the University of Chicago</strike>&nbsp; strategy consultant in Chicago. 
    <br><br>The biggest constant throughout my life has been my love for food. I created this blog as a way for me to challenge myself after graduating from UChicago, not only by learning how to code and design a website, but also by pushing myself to use this space as a creative outlet. My goal is to further and document my growth one dish at a time, and I hope you join me.</p>
