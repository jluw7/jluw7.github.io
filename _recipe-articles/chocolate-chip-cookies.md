When I was a child, my parents had a membership to BJ’s Wholesale Club. I thought BJ’s was a magical place, mostly because the BJ’s bakery section had giant birthday cakes (still my favorite birthday cake—can you beat whipped cream covered marble cake with a layer of light chocolate mousse in the middle?) and the most amazing chocolate chunk cookies. I am ashamed to admit that I once brought the latter to a bake sale in elementary school and claimed that I had made them myself. I earned received the admiration of everyone who tried those cookies that day and suffered much guilt, but in my defense, the PTA had instructed us to bring home-baked goods and my parents (bless them) were too busy with work to bake something for me. BUT TODAY I amend my past transgression, as I am determined to be able to make just as delicious of a cookie, and hopefully sharing that recipe with the world will earn me those brownie—cookie, really—points I undeservedly got so many years ago. 


Now, I am not at all a baking person. When I cook, I hate having to follow recipes closely, and I am very imprecise when it comes to adding ingredients. Unfortunately, that doesn’t bode well for me in the baking world. Today I am on an exploration, and I am determined to do things right. I am about to foray into the world of cookies, and this requires much research. 


I took a look at the famous Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chip cookie recipe, as this is the only cookie whose recipe I have available to me of which I know the taste. My plan is to use this recipe and adjust as I see fit to manipulate it into the cookies of my childhood. Honestly, I don’t understand the obsession with Nestle Tollhouse cookies. I might get crucified for saying this, but I don’t enjoy them. I think they are too sweet, too greasy, too flat, and don’t have the chewy texture that I like. 


To fix the texture issue: I learned that chilling the cookie dough for 24 hours will help the cookies become less flat when baked, chewier, and more flavorful. Unfortunately, I only have 16 hours. Sigh, poor planning on my part. However, there are diminishing returns as you chill for longer, with the first hours being the most crucial, so I should be okay. Additionally, increasing the proportion of brown sugar should cause the cookie to flatten out less. 


I also think that brown sugar has less of an in-your-face type of sweetness than regular granulated sugar, so I’m hoping that that solves my sweetness issue as well.


Finally, the key is the large chocolate chunks. This is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of BJ’s cookies, so no tiny chocolate chips around here.
