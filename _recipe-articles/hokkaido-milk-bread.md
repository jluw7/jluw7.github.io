My first memory of eating milk bread takes place at Chicago’s Momotaro. The first dish of the evening was the restaurant’s namesake dish, a sweet tomato (variety: “Momotaro”) tartare served with milk bread toast. That tomato tartare was the star of the night, but two years later, the milk bread remains the unsung hero of the dish. I still remember how fluffy the bread was, how the lightness of each bite balanced with the thickness of the slices, how the mild sweetness had me coming back for more. I’ve accepted the fact that I likely will never be able to recreate that Momotaro tartare, but the idea of being able to have milk bread whenever I desire! Well, that was the idea that drove me to create this recipe. Once you experience the joy of fluffy, homemade bread, you won't be able to stop making it!
