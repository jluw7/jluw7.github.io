  <p style="font-size: 1.5rem">1 cup raw nuts, such as cashews, almonds, hazelnuts, pecans, etc.<br><br>4 cups hot water, plus water for soaking<br><br>3   tsp raw honey<br><br>pinch of sea salt<br><br><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>  tsp vanilla extract (optional)</p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.5rem">Choose raw nuts with an opaque, off-white interior. Nuts with translucent or dark interiors are likely going rancid and have already released oil. If you can, remove the skin of the nuts, which is astringent. However, if you can't, take comfort in knowing that the skins contain additional antioxidants. </p><br>
  <h4><strong>Directions</strong></h4><br>
  <ol style="font-size: 1.5rem">
      <li>  No less than 12 hours in advance, place nuts in a large bowl and cover with filtered water by at least a couple inches. Let sit for 12-48 hours. Soaking is an essential step because blending dry nuts extracts only oil as the liquid phase of the blended paste. Soaking the nuts allows you to obtain a continuous water-based mixture of oil bodies, proteins, sugars, and salts â€• aka nut milk.</li><br>
      <li>  Drain and rinse nuts before adding into blender with honey, sea salt, vanilla extract, and 4 cups of fresh, hot, filtered water (hot water helps to release the oil bodies and integrate with water, resulting in creamy milk). Blend on high until smooth, about 2-3 minutes.</li><br>
      <li>  Leave nut milk unstrained for more nutritional value or strain through nut milk bag/cheesecloth/fine-mesh sieve, making sure to squeeze nut pulp to extract all liquid. Save the nut pulp, which contains most of the nutrients, for other purposes: it can be added to granola before baking, frozen in ice cube trays and popped into smoothies, folded into oatmeal and various batters, etc.</li><br>
      <li>  Store in airtight container in fridge. Nut milk should last for 3-4 days. No matter how well you strain, nut milk will naturally separate as it sits. Shake well before use.</li><br>
