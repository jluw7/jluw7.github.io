I'm such a sucker for pickles. I love the saltiness, the crunch, the tang that keeps me coming back for more. However, sometimes the strong taste is a bit too much to snack on without accompanying other food. I also love cucumbersâ€”I'll snack on them plain like they're pretzels. This recipe for lightly pickled cucumbers is the perfect balance between everything that I love about pickles and the freshness of a crisp cucumber. They're so easy to make, keep well in the fridge for whenever you need them, and can be a refreshing snack or side to a meal. Make these pickled cucumbers once, and you'll find yourself making them over and over again.
