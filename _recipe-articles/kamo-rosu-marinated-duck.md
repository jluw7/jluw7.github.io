I love duck. If I see a duck entree on a menu, I will choose it over any other meat dish 9 times out of 10. I used to have this perception that duck was difficult to make because it seemed so uncommon to see in homecooking. Truth be told, making a perfect medium-rare pan-seared duck breast is not difficult to do, but even easier is this marinated duck breast, which stays moist and juicy with a large margin of error. Called *kamo rosu*, meaning "roast duck" in Japanese, this duck breast is actually briefly pan-seared on both sides, poached, and then marinated in the poaching liquid.

Meant to be served cold, this is a great recipe to make in advance. It requires little prep and cook time but appears impressive with its rich flavors. Kamo rosu is perfect to start a meal, accompany a salad or noodles, or simply serve with rice.
