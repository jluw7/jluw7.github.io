Since trying Hainan chicken at Savoy in LA, I have been determined to make my own. It was my first and only time eating Hainan Chicken so I can’t completely know if it is the gold standard I think it is, or if my attempts are close to the authentic dish, but if it tastes good it tastes good, right?

&nbsp;      

I have a few elements that I think define a great Hainan chicken dish:
1. The chicken meat must be juicy, velvety, and flavorful.
The Approach: Poach gently using the residual heat of the poaching liquid instead of directly cooking the chicken. Keep the skin intact in order to keep all of the juices in. 
2. The skin must be smooth, springy, and have an almost gelatin like texture to it.
The Approach: This will happen if we exfoliate the chicken well and keep the skin intact.
3. The rice must be fragrant, perfectly cooked, and evidently flavored by the chicken broth.
4. The sauces must be delicious on their own without overpowering the chicken.

The key to the goodness of this recipe is the quality of the chicken. Chickens that you buy in the supermarket in the United States are unfortunately not very flavorful (I once witnessed my grandfather make an amazing pot of chicken broth using only two tiny chicken drumsticks in China). So make sure you buy the freshest, free range, organic, grub-eating chicken you can.

After you’ve bought the best chicken you can buy, it’s time to treat your chicken like it deserves. This means giving that chicken a good facial! Yep, you heard me right. We’re going to exfoliate our chicken. Taking a handful of salt, rub the outside of the entire chicken gently in small circles, making sure not to tear the skin. No matter how clean your chicken appears on the outside, this salt exfoliation will remove any gunk or loose bits of skin on the outside, while imparting your chicken with a glossy sheen. Do not skip this step! It is crucial to make sure your broth is nice and clear and your chicken skin ends up smooth and glistening at the end. Make sure to keep the skin intact, as this will trap all of the yummy juices inside while poaching. I like to spread some salt around the inside cavity of the chicken and the outside of the chicken as well and leave overnight before rinsing off. This way, the chicken will be well seasoned after poaching, without making the broth too salty.

Treat your chicken gently with care, and you will reap the benefits. This recipe is much easier than the number of steps suggest, and it results in a simple, clean meal that feeds four or reheats well as leftovers. Be patient in understanding the *why* behind the *how* of each step, and you are bound to succeed.
