It's shocking to think of now, but I didn't start using fish sauce until a few years ago. In China, fish sauce, or *yúlù* (鱼露), is most popular in the southeastern provinces, so my parents, who primarily made dishes from the northeastern province that they grew up in, never introduced me to fish sauce. Instead, I grew up using dried cuttlefish, dried shrimp, and dried scallops to obtain a similar savory umami flavor. Imagine my surprise when I found out that fish sauce served as a terrific, cheap substitute! Nowadays, I use fish sauce in a variety of ways: flavoring my chicken broth, making kimchi, and—one of my favorites—creating this umami bomb vinaigrette.

I put my fish sauce vinaigrette on pretty much every veggie, but I think it goes especially well with tender, sweet, earthy broccolini. Make a small batch of vinaigrette ahead of time, and whip it out to create an amazing vegetable dish in minutes.
