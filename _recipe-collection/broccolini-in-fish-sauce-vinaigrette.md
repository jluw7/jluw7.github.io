#### **Making the Fish Sauce Vinaigrette** 

<br>

In a bowl, combine lemon juice and shallot and set aside for at least 20 minutes so the acid tempers the raw sharpness of the shallot. Add the fish sauce and chili powder before whisking while slowly drizzling in both oils until combined and emulsified.

<br>

#### **Making the Broccolini** 

<br>

Trim the ends of the broccolini stems and halve lengthwise if thicker than 1/4 an inch. Quickly blanch broccolini in a pot of boiling water for 2 minutes.  Drain and toss with fish sauce vinaigrette.
