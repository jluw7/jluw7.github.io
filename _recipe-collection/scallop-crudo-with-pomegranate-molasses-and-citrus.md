title: Scallop Crudo with Pomegranate Molasses and Citrus
image-1: 
image-2: 
description: This crudo is the perfect way to showcase the freshest citrus fruits of the season. 
advice: In this recipe, I use lemons, limes, and orange varieties, but any citrus will highlight the sweetness of fresh, raw scallops. Feel free to swap with whatever is in season or freshest for you. Meyer lemon is preferred to regular lemon, but if you canâ€™t find Meyer lemons to juice, replace with 1/2 lemon juice and 1/2 orange juice.
servings: Serves 4 as a side or starter
