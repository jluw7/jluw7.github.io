#### **Making the Chicken** 

<br>

1. The day before you wish to cook, exfoliate the chicken. Using a generous amount of salt, exfoliate the chicken by rubbing the salt in small circles in order to get off all the gross bits on the surface. Make sure that you don’t break the skin! Rinse off the salt to remove the gross bits and salt once again. Make sure you rub some salt on the inside cavity too. Cover the chicken and let sit in the fridge overnight.        

2. When you’re ready to cook, take the chicken out of the fridge and rinse off the salt. Trim some of the fat from the chicken from the back cavity, but do not pierce the skin. Save the fat and set the chicken aside for 20 minutes. We want to bring the chicken close to room temperature so that we don’t change the water temperature too much when we begin poaching.      
    
3. Fill a large pot with enough filtered/spring/distilled water that after adding the chicken to the pot, the water will be just barely covering the top of the chicken. This will likely require filling the pot about 2/3 of the way high. Place the pot on high heat and bring water to a boil.        

4. Slice one of the pieces of ginger and cut the green onions in half. Place inside the cavity of the chicken.        

5. When the water has come to a boil, add the chicken, breast side down. If the water does not fully cover the chicken, add more boiling water. If the water covers the chicken by more than an inch, discard some of the water. Using a large wooden spoon, gently rock the chicken back and forth so that the water inside the cavity is changed a few times. This ensures that no cold water is trapped inside the chicken. MAKE SURE NOT TO BREAK THE SKIN WHILE DOING SO. I like to hold onto the legs to do this step (but this requires high heat tolerance), or I’ll take a large wooden and hook it inside the cavity of the chicken to move it around.        

6. As the water comes up to a boil again, gently stir the chicken and remove the scum as it appears. When the water comes back up to a boil, add a piece of dried cuttlefish and rock the chicken back and forth again. Cover the pot and remove from the heat. Let the chicken poach for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, place the pot back on heat. Flip the chicken over, breast side up. Cover the pot and wait until the water is brought back up to a boil. After the water comes back up to a boil, rock the chicken back and forth again a few times. Remove from heat again and set a timer for 20 minutes. Once again, place the pot back on the heat, flip chicken breast side down, and bring up to a boil again. Rock the chicken once more before covering and removing from heat again. Set a final timer for 20 minutes.      

7. A few minutes before the timer is up, prepare a large ice bath with as much ice as possible.     

8. After the 20 minutes is up, gently lift the chicken out of the pot, careful not to break the skin, and add the chicken to the ice bath immediately in order to stop the cooking. Make sure to periodically rotate the chicken if the ice bath does not completely submerge the chicken. This step also helps the chicken skin become tight and springy. You can discard the ginger and green onion at this point.        

9. Taste the soup and add salt and white pepper as needed.      

10. Skim off the fat from the soup and set aside for making the rice. 

11. Remove the chicken from the ice bath when cooled and pat dry. Carve chicken and serve with rice, sauces, and broth.

#### **Making the Rice** 

<br>

1. Finely mince or grate one clove of garlic.       

2. Add the garlic and chicken fat previously taken from the back cavity to a hot pan on medium heat. Let the fat render before removing the crispy bits (a yummy snack!) and adding the rice to the pan.      

3. Stir fry the rice for a few minutes, until you see it becoming slightly translucent.         

4. Add the rice to a rice cooker and add 3 cups of the chicken fat from the broth (or chicken stock after you run out of the fat) to the rice cooker. Let the rice cooker do the rest of the cooking.

#### **Making the Sauces** 

<br>

1. Ginger sauce: There are two ways of making the ginger sauce. The easiest way if you want to make a large amount is by using a small food processor. You can blend the remaining piece of ginger with two tablespoons of canola oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, then gently cook the mixture in a small frying pan until golden. If you only want to make a small amount of ginger sauce or don’t want to use a food processor, grating the ginger will suffice.     

2. The soy sauce: Pretty simple! Dissolve a tablespoon of red sugar in three tablespoons of soy sauce and add a tablespoon of sesame oil.       

3. The chili sauce: Seed and chop red chilies. Combine chilies, 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp red sugar, and 1 tbsp chicken stock in a blender. Process until a fine paste forms.
