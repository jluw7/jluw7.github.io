3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>   tsp instant dry yeast       

1 cup water     

<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>     cup cream       

<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>     cup milk        

1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>   eggs, whisked

#### **Making the Tangzhong** 

<br>
1. In a bowl, combine <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup bread flour and 1 cup water, working out any lumps. You can substitute the water for milk for a milkier bread.

2. Gently cook the mixture in a pan on medium heat. The tangzhong will be done when you can create ribbons with your spatula, or when you can run your spatula along the bottom of the pan without the mixture immediately filling in the space again.

3. Transfer the tangzhong out of the pan into a bowl and cover the top of the tangzhong with a cloth or plastic wrap. Let cool to room temperature.

#### **Making the Bread**

<br>
1. Add all of the ingredients except the butter into a breadmaker by first putting in the wet ingredients (cream, milk, egg, tangzhong) before including the dry ingredients (bread flour, caster sugar, powdered milk, yeast). Dip a finger into the flour to create an indent to contain the yeast. 

2. Select the “dough” mode on the breadmaker, which typically takes 30 minutes to knead. When the ingredients have just come together, pour in the melted butter and allow the breadmaker to finish the “dough” mode until a smooth, elastic ball is formed. 

3. Allow the dough to undergo a first round of proofing until double in size, about 45 minutes. Many breadmakers’ “dough” modes include a round of proofing after kneading. If not, cover the dough and place in a warm, slightly humid area. (Note: I think heated vents are a pretty good spot.)

4. Cover a clean, flat surface with a light layer of flour before transferring the dough. 

5. Divide the dough into three roughly equal portions. No need to fret if you deflate the dough during this step, but make sure not to overly squish and compact the dough. 

6. Cover with a cloth or plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes at room temperature.

7. Starting with one portion, roll out with a rolling pin into an oval shape, about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> an inch thick. 

8. Taking one of the long edges, fold toward the other edge, to about <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the width and press. Repeat with the other edge. 

9. Flip the portion so that the seal is facing downward. Roll out again until the portion is about a foot long. 

10. Flip again so the seal is facing upward. Roll into a cylinder and place into loaf tin, with seal facing downward. 

11. Repeat with the other two portions. 

12. Allow the dough to undergo a second round of proofing, until double in size. The dough will benefit from an even warmer and more humid spot than before. 

13. Meanwhile, preheat oven at 350F.

14. Brush whisked egg on surface of dough. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool on a wire rack.
