description: A healthy, homemade milk substitute.
advice: Choose raw nuts with an opaque, off-white interior. Nuts with translucent or dark interiors likely have begun to turn rancid and have already released oil. If you can, remove the skin of the nuts, which is astringent. However, if you can't, take comfort in knowing that the skins contain additional antioxidants.
servings: Makes 3-4 cups

1 cup raw nuts, such as almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, etc.

#### **Making Basic Nut Milk** 

<br>

1. No less than 12 hours in advance, place nuts in a large bowl and cover with filtered water by at least a couple inches. Let sit for 12-48 hours. Soaking is an essential step because blending dry nuts extracts only oil as the liquid phase of the blended paste. Soaking the nuts allows you to obtain a continuous water-based mixture of oil bodies, proteins, sugars, and salts â€• aka nut milk.        
&nbsp; 

2. Drain and rinse nuts. At this points, the skins of many nuts will easily slide off if you gently squeeze each nut. Add nuts into blender with honey, vanilla extract, sea salt, and 3 cups of hot, filtered water (hot water helps to release the oil bodies and integrate with water, resulting in creamy milk). Blend on high until smooth, about 2-3 minutes.      
&nbsp; 

3. Leave nut milk unstrained for more nutritional value or strain through nut milk bag/cheesecloth/fine-mesh sieve, making sure to squeeze nut pulp to extract all liquid. Save the nut pulp, which contains most of the nutrients, for other purposes! Taste nut milk and dilute with extra water or add sweetness as needed.       
&nbsp;  

4. Store in airtight container in fridge. Nut milk should last for 3-4 days. No matter how well you strain, nut milk will naturally separate as it sits. Shake well before use.

- Almond and Cold Brew: almond milk as above + cold brew
- Cashew and Date: cashew milk with one date instead of honey + cinnamon
- Oat and Maple: swap nuts for oats and honey for maple syrup
- Pistachio and Lemon: pistachio milk (or half pistachio, half oat milk) + infused lemon peel
