4 mini seedless cucumbers           

1 tsp fine sea salt     

1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches kombu, cut into shreds     

3 tbsp seasoned rice vinegar        

<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> granulated sugar        

<!--more-->

<br>

#### **Directions** 

1. Wash the cucumbers and pat dry. Rub the cucumbers with the salt, cut them into <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch slices, and place in a glass jar or plastic container. Add the kombu to the jar. 
<br> 

2. Add the vinegar, sugar, and enough water to cover the cucumbers in the jar. If using a glass jar with a metal lid, cover the top of the jar with plastic wrap before screwing on the lid in order to prevent the acidic vinegar from reacting with the metal lid and affecting the taste of the pickles. After tightly securing the lid of the container, give the jar a quick shake.

3. Let the cucumbers marinate in the refrigerator overnight, or at least 12 hours, before eating.
