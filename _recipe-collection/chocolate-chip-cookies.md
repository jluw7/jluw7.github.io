1. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt.
2. In a mixing bowl, cream the butter until soft and gradually add brown sugar. Beat until creamy. 
3. Beat in vanilla and each egg separately, mixing after each addition. 
4. Gradually mix in dry ingredients.
5. Roll dough into a large log, about an inch and a half in diameter. Wrap the log in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours. 
6. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Slice the log into rounds about half an inch thick. Keep the unused dough refrigerated. Place the rounds about 2 inches apart on the baking sheet, and bake for 8 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring over to a plate to cool with a large flat spatula.
