      <h3>Why the name "Boil Three Times"?</h3>
      <br><p>When I was younger, my parents would occasionally spend an entire day folding dumplings. The process was always a mystery to me. My mom never measured the amount of each ingredient to go into the filling, and my dad would always sniff the mixture in order to tell if it needed more salt or not. At the very end, the dumplings would be cooked as follows: add dumplings and wait until water comes up to a boil, and then add cold water to stop the boil and let it return to a boil once more (3 times). I never understood the need to add cold water and boil three times. When I would ask my parents, they would shrug and say that that was the way "we" had always done it. I knew that the "we" referred to Chinese people as a whole, but growing up I had always wondered if I belonged to that "we." Thinking about my parents making dumplings, I found myself lost, realizing that I couldn't bring myself to fully accept the method nor reject it. Since that first realization, I've had many years to teach myself how to cook both based on the centuries-old methods that I've observed from my parents and the research that I've enthusiastically consumed in my free time. I discovered a balance between trusting traditions and instructions and learning the fundamentals of cooking as a science. My cooking philosophy is that the true key to success is digesting existing knowledge and understanding the <i><b>why</b></i> behind each <i><b>how</b></i>. While recipes are great, if you know the science and reasoning of each step then you can easily modify recipes, improvise, or create your own. So, boil three times or don't, just make sure you understand why.</p><br><br>
